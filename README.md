# Senior-Project
This is my product for my senior project at the OLHS Math and Science Academy. 
As of writing this, it's techinically completeded, but there are some problems and it needs to be changed. 
The main problem being it takes a very long time to run, so while it theoretically works, it coming through a very very large amount of possibilities. 
Just as an example because I don't know exactly how many, the rubiks cubes has roughly 43 quintillion possibilities in it
i.e 4*10^19
